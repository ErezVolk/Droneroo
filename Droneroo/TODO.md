#  TODO List

- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/creating-your-app-icon-using-icon-composer
- Kotlin multiplatform? Flutter?
  - https://blog.kotlin-academy.com/building-your-first-kotlin-multiplatform-app-from-setup-to-ios-app-store-with-compose-e4d3f4c6767c?gi=d18273130976
- Tempo bookmarks
- Timer (wall/drone)
- Look for something less exposed than UserDefaults (`@SceneStorage` isn't persistent enough for me [or is it?])
- Different layout for iPhone/iPad https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68414871
- Different color scheme for desktop, at the very least something more somber and less pastel
  - Lookup "different color schemes on iOS/Mac"
- Jump to note (from the current sequence) NOW (wheel)
- Piano keyboard
- Support chords
- Get clicks from a specific keyboard even when not in focus (maybe using Karabiner/BTT)
- Configurable and savable sequences
- Chord (or anything) which then moves according to the circle defined, i.e., pattern relative to current, i.e., an extension to the current octave thing
