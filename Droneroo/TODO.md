  - https://livsycode.com/swiftui/implementing-the-glasseffect-in-swiftui/
  - glassEffectUnion for the merger
- Kotlin multiplatform? Flutter?

- Tempo bookmarks
- Timer (wall/drone)
- Look for something less exposed than UserDefaults (`@SceneStorage` isn't persistent enough for me [or is it?])
- Different layout for iPhone/iPad https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68414871
- Different color scheme for desktop, at the very least something more somber and less pastel
  - Lookup "different color schemes on iOS/Mac"
- Jump to note (from the current sequence) NOW (wheel)
- Piano keyboard
- Support chords
- Get clicks from a specific keyboard even when not in focus (maybe using Karabiner/BTT)
- Configurable and savable sequences
- Chord (or anything) which then moves according to the circle defined, i.e., pattern relative to current, i.e., an extension to the current octave thing
