#  TODO List

- Move audio settings to a window
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37296929/implement-document-picker
- Pick a note (from the current sequence) NOW (wheel)
- Piano keyboard
- Support chords
- "About..." (how does that work in mobile?)
- Get clicks from a specific keyboard even when not in focus (maybe using Karabiner/BTT)
- Configurable and savable sequences
- Load specific instrument from soundbank (echo 'inst 1' |fluidsynth foobar.sf2)
- Chord (or anything) which then moves according to the circle defined, i.e., pattern relative to current, i.e., an extension to the current octave thing
